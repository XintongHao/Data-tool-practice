    "In this assignment, we will work on Facebook posts. The goal is to determine the number of comments a post will receive. Being able to predict the number of comments of a post can be viewed as predicting the impact a post will have, which makes this task quite challenging and interesting. You can find the dataset and details about it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics#) and [here](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0148296316000813/1-s2.0-S0148296316000813-main.pdf?_tid=1944e5a8-e211-4dbc-bdd6-b233e4df6465&acdnat=1522453539_a59ca4034d01f4654986e45e18e79883). \n",

    "As learned in class most algorithms can only handle numeric values. However, in the given dataset you can see that the values of column 'Type' are categorical. Your first task is to prepare your dataset for linear regression and transform this column into numerical values. Note that creating a mapping that replaces the type field with a single number (e.g. Photo -> 1, Status ->2, Link ->3,...), will not be helpful here since the types are not ordered. Instead, use the \"indicator vector\" representation discussed in class. \n",

The dependent variable should be the column 'comment' and the remaining columns of your dataset should be the independent variables. Split your dataset into 80% and 20% for training and testing, respectively. Report the linear model's summary as shown [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) by using the .summary() function after fitting your model and compute the error of your prediction using the [mean squared error (MSE)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html).  **(2 pt)**"

Note that regularization's goal is to reduce overfitting, that is it creates a more generalized linear model and removes possible noise from the dataset. You will complete this task by using the .fit_regularized() method, and more specifically the **ridge fit**. More details can be found [here](http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.fit_regularized.html). Perform Kfold cross-validation, where K = 5, to both the linear model and the regularized linear model, in order to decide which performs better. Report the MSE of the two models. Remember to shuffle the data before performing cross-validation. **(2 pt)**"

    "Another way that may help us improve the MSE is by adding quadratic terms of significant variables in the model. Add 2 quadratic terms in your **regularized linear model** based on two significant variables. An interesting and intuitive tutorial about understanding which are the significant variables and the importance of quadratic terms can be found [here](http://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interpret-coefficients-p-values-regression/). Note that in order to add the quadratic terms you will need to change the formula of your model, as in [example](http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/formulas.html) and in [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31978948/python-stats-models-quadratic-term-in-regression/36539157). Perform Kfold cross-validation, where K = 5, to both the linear model and the regularized linear model with quadratic terms, in order to decide which performs better. Report the MSE of the two models. Remember to shuffle the data before performing cross-validation. **(2 pt)**"
