Kitchen and bathroom are basic- all crockery, plates. etc are  a hodgepodge of old mismatched stuff. Bathroom is clean but sinks, bath and taps need replacing. All work fine but are badly marked, old and chipped/cracked. Apartment needs to be properly painted and spruced up. Windows need to be double glazed and some blinds replaced. It all works but its rustic.  You are paying for location here.\n",

Carol the manager was quick to answer questions and respond to requests, for  example we asked for an oven glove, wine glasses and a dish towel and these were all provided the next day.  She gave us a modem, at no additional charge, to allow us to access WIFI when we were out and about. Own key to front door and apartment, working lift to 4th floor.  Effective air-con. Hairdryer, iron, ironing board, all provided. Laundromat is on the corner of the apartment block so its easy to wash and dry clothes.\n",
